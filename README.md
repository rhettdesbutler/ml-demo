# ML Demo (Under Development)

Repo for showing current knowledge and capabilities of the author regarding Machine Learning tools and techniques.

### Technologies being used:

The ML repo uses:

- Scikit-learn
- Tensorflow
- Python

### Deployment

#### Running each project locally:

This repository uses jupyter-notebooks to run each project. Make sure to install jupyter notebooks along with required dependencies.


### Projects:

In `/projects`:

- Supervised Projects: 
    - `Linear Regression`: Car Prices data from `kaggle.com` using pipeline to normalise then train and predict.
    - `Logistic Regression`: Hear Disease data from `kaggle.com` using scaling and normalisation in a pipeline before making inferences.
    - `SVM` (Support Vector Machines):
    - `KNN` (K-Nearest Neighbour):
    - `NB` (NaiveBayes):
    - `CNN` (Convolutional Neural Network): Download and unzip data to `datasets/supervised/fish_data` location from `https://www.kaggle.com/crowww/a-large-scale-fish-dataset/download`

- Unsupervised Projects:
